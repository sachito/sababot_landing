<p>Welcome to Sababot, a service offered by Intelligence+ (. ("Sababot", "Sababot.com", “Intelligence+”, “IPlus”, “we”, “us” or “our”).<br><br>
Please read these Terms of Service (the “Terms”) carefully because they govern your use of our Site and our online service accessible via our Site and bot  (“Bot”). We provide the services to individuals associated with (e.g., as an employee of) a customer of Intelligence+. To make these Terms easier to read, the Site, our services and Bot are collectively called the “Services.”</p><br><br>
<h3 class="h3-terms">1.Agreement to Terms</h3>
<p>By using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and by our Privacy Policy. If you don’t agree to these Terms and our Privacy Policy, do not use the Services.<br><br>
For the avoidance of doubt, we do not provide a betting service. Sababot is a game where points are awarded for correct predictions. No prizes, cash or non-cash, are paid out to players by Sababot, Sababot.com or any affiliated companies.</p><br><br>
<h3 class="h3-terms">2.Changes to Terms or Services</h3>
<p>We may modify the Terms at any time, in our sole discretion, including by promulgating specific policies or guidelines for use of the Services, which will become part of these Terms. If we do so, we’ll let you know either by posting the modified Terms on the Site or through other communications (including, as to Specific Policies, by reference in the documentation describing the proper use of the Services). It’s important that you review the Terms whenever we modify them because if you continue to use the Services after we have posted modified Terms on the Site, you are indicating to us that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by the modified Terms, then you may not use the Services anymore. Because our Services are evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Services, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.</p><br><br>
<h3 class="h3-terms">3. Who May Use the Services</h3>
<p>Eligibility. You may use the Services only if you are 18 years or older and capable of forming a binding contract with Intelligence+  and are not barred from using the Services under applicable law. You agree that you won’t disclose your Account password to anyone and you’ll notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your Account. You’re responsible for all activities that occur under your Account, whether or not you know about them.</p><br><br>
<h3 class="h3-terms">4. Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>Please refer to our Privacy Policy (www.sababot.com/privacy) for information on how we collect, use and disclose information from our users.</p><br><br>

Content includes without limitation User Content.</p><br><br>

<h3 class="h3-terms">6. Content Ownership, Responsibility and Removal</h3>

Subject to the foregoing, Intelligence+ and its licensors exclusively own all right, title and interest in and to the Services and Content, including all associated intellectual property rights. You acknowledge that the Services and Content are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of France and foreign countries. You agree not to remove, alter or obscure any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Services or Content.<br><br>

You are solely responsible for all your User Content. You represent and warrant that you own all your User Content or you have all rights that are necessary to grant us the license rights in your User Content under these Terms. You also represent and warrant that neither your User Content, nor your use and provision of your User Content to be made available through the Services, nor any use of your User Content by Intelligence+ on or through the Services will infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party’s intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or result in the violation of any contract by which you are bound, or of any applicable law or regulation.<br><br>
You can remove your User Content by specifically deleting it. However, in certain instances, some of your User Content (such as responses) may not be completely removed and copies of your User Content may continue to exist on the Services.

In this case, we will refund the price of the Product in full.<br><br>
We will refund any money received from you, normally by using the same method originally used by you to pay for your purchase.</p><br><br>
<h3 class="h3-terms">10. POINTS AWARDED</h3>
<p>Points will be awarded to you according to the rules and points system as explained in the <a href="../how-it-works">How it Works?</a> section of the website.<br><br>

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN NO EVENT WILL INTELLIGENCE+’S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES OR CONTENT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100). THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN Intelligence+ AND YOU.

<h3 class="h3-terms">16. Dispute Resolution</h3>
<p>Governing Law. These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of Paris, France without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. General Terms<br><br>
These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Intelligence+ and you regarding the Services and Content, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between INTELLIGENCE+ and you regarding the Services and Content.

You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Intelligence+’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null. Intelligence+ may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction.

For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.<br><br>
INTELLIGENCE+’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Intelligence+. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.</p><br><br>
